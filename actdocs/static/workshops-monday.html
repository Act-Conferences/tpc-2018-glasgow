        THIS EVENT HAS UNFORTUNATELY BEEN CANCELLED DUE TO THE SPEAKER'S COMMITMENTS  
        A three-part course focused on getting your internal outlook correct, how
        to approach dealing with others, and follow up to help solve problems. I
        will condense a plethora of reading and give cited examples on each
        process to help people understand where the message they are trying
        to convey is getting lost and help them to better facilitate their
        conversations with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        With 4 years experience working with programmers in soft skills coaching
        role I have seen these techniques work and want to pass them on to make
        the community a better place to be in.

        Introduction to Perl 6
      </h4>
      <p>
        Time: <b>Full day:</b> 09:30 - 17:30<br>
        Target audience: Intermediate <br>
        Language: English <br>
      </p>
      <p>
            Starting from one-liners like 'Hello, world!' Jeffrey explores all of
            the programming styles that Perl 6 has on offer, from basic procedural
            programming to object-oriented style, aspect-oriented, functional
            programming, and even logic programming. From the basics of sigils
            (the signs that so many scratch their heads over) and context, you'll
            banish lazy evaluation, march through infinite lists, and stalk the wild
            hyperoperators. Jeffrey introduces simple variables and user I/O by way
            of a guessing game.  You'll walk out of the tutorial with a solid grasp
            of the fundamentals of Perl 6 and an exposure to what lies beyond the
            world of basic scripting.
