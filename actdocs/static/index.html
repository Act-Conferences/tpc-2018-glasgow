      <h4>
        The Studio, 14th-17 August 2018
      </h4>
      <p>
        Perl has been in the public domain for thirty years and 2018 is the thirty-first year, this marks a second generation. So what do we want to show from the first generation and first thirty years? What do the next thirty years of Perl look like? We invite you to think on this as you submit your talks but do not feel constrained by the theme.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Perl Conference is an open and welcoming community event and as such we welcome submission on any subject. Do not feel imprisoned by a particular language. We welcome talks on other languages and technical matters relating to programming and software development, we also welcome community and infrastructure talks.

        About The Perl Conference
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Perl Conference - which in the Perl community is usually referred to as Yet Another Perl Conference Europe (YAPC::EU) - is the annual meeting of Perl Mongers, developers, administrators, technical managers and interested parties in Europe. In 2018 the European Perl Conference will be held at The Studio in Glasgow between 13th-17th August.
      </p>
      <p>
        YAPC started off as a series of grassroots user meetings, with discussions among Perl Mongers, and has grown from there. The very first OSCON grew out of the original Perl Conference. The focus is on enjoying the ideas of others, discovering new concepts, and feeling the enthusiasm of fellow programmers. Although our conference is devoted primarily to the Perl 5 and Perl 6 programming languages we appreciate and value discussions and submissions from other languages and technical disciplines.
