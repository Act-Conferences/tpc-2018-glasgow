<h2>
Welcome to Glasgow
</h2>

<p>
The Perl Conference - which in the Perl community has been known as Yet Another Perl Conference Europe (YAPC::EU) - is the annual meeting of Perl Mongers, Developers and interested parties in Europe. The European Perl Conference will be held at The Studio in Glasgow between 13th-17th August 2018.
</p>

<p>
The Perl conferences started off as a series of grassroots user meetings, with discussions among Perl Mongers, and has grown from there. The very first OSCON grew out of the original Perl Conferences. The focus is on enjoying the ideas of others, discovering new concepts, and feeling the enthusiasm of fellow programmers in the Perl 5 and Perl 6 programming languages.
