        Crash course - Object Oriented Perl 5

        Although Perl is famous for its powerful one-liners and quirky syntax,
        there's also an extensive framework for fully-fledged OO programming. In
        this half day class I'll introduce OO programming then take you from the
        built-in 'bless' through to Moo and Moose frameworks together with types,
        inheritance, roles and the object lifecycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only requirement is that you're comfortable with non-OO Perl
        programming. To make sure of that, as soon as you sign-up for this course
        I'll give you a 3 month enrolment in
        <a href="https://geekuni.com/course/perl-essentials">Geekuni's online Perl Essentials
        course</a> which has everything you need to know for this class.

            Most of us have web sites. And for most of those web sites, success
            means getting more visitors visit it. And that means getting better
            ranking in Google. And that means SEO.
      </p>
      <p>
            You can spend hours poring over spreadsheets of keywords that you want
            your web site to rank for. But there's another side to SEO. There are a
            number of relatively simple tweaks you can make to your site in order
            to make it more attractive to Google. Over the course of three hours,
            we will cover some of these.

            is a database framework (a.k.a "Object Relational
            Mapping" or "ORM") which presents the data as objects and keeps SQL at
            arm's-length. In this class I'll show you how to use DBIx::Class to make
            your code easier (and more pleasant) to maintain.

      <p>
            For this course you should be comfortable writing Perl and SQL. As soon

        Being a successful professional programmer isn't just about being good
        at programming. There are plenty of other skills that a programmer should
        have and in this three-hour session, Dave Cross (who, despite appearances
        to the contrary, has been doing this for thirty years) will explain some
        of them to you.
