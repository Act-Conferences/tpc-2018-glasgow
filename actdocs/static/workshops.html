        Although Perl is famous for its powerful one-liners and quirky syntax,
        there's also an extensive framework for fully-fledged OO programming. In
        this half day class I'll introduce OO programming then take you from the
        built-in 'bless' through to Moo and Moose frameworks together with types,
        inheritance, roles and the object lifecycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only requirement is that you're comfortable with non-OO Perl
        programming. To make sure of that, as soon as you sign-up for this course
        I'll give you a 3 month enrolment in
        <a href="https://geekuni.com/course/perl-essentials">Geekuni's online Perl Essentials
        course</a> which has everything you need to know for this class.

            is a database framework (a.k.a "Object Relational
            Mapping" or "ORM") which presents the data as objects and keeps SQL at
            arm's-length. In this class I'll show you how to use DBIx::Class to make
            your code easier (and more pleasant) to maintain.

            For this course you should be comfortable writing Perl and SQL. As soon

        A three-part course focused on getting your internal outlook correct, how
        to approach dealing with others, and follow up to help solve problems. I
        will condense a plethora of reading and give cited examples on each
        process to help people understand where the message they are trying
        to convey is getting lost and help them to better facilitate their
        conversations with others.

        With 4 years experience working with programmers in soft skills coaching
        role I have seen these techniques work and want to pass them on to make
        the community a better place to be in.

            Most of us have web sites. And for most of those web sites, success
            means getting more visitors visit it. And that means getting better
            ranking in Google. And that means SEO.
      </p>
      <p>
            You can spend hours poring over spreadsheets of keywords that you want
            your web site to rank for. But there's another side to SEO. There are a
            number of relatively simple tweaks you can make to your site in order
            to make it more attractive to Google. Over the course of three hours,
            we will cover some of these.

        at programming. There are plenty of other skills that a programmer should
        have and in this three-hour session, Dave Cross (who, despite appearances

        Introduction to Perl 6

            Starting from one-liners like 'Hello, world!' Jeffrey explores all of
            the programming styles that Perl 6 has on offer, from basic procedural
            programming to object-oriented style, aspect-oriented, functional
            programming, and even logic programming. From the basics of sigils
            (the signs that so many scratch their heads over) and context, you'll
            banish lazy evaluation, march through infinite lists, and stalk the wild
            hyperoperators. Jeffrey introduces simple variables and user I/O by way
            of a guessing game.  You'll walk out of the tutorial with a solid grasp
            of the fundamentals of Perl 6 and an exposure to what lies beyond the
            world of basic scripting.
