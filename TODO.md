A list of things we might want to improve. Feel free to add stuff (or do stuff!)

* [ ] Add text to the pricing page about the lack of business tickets (and linking to the sponsorship page)
* [ ] Add a sponsorshop page (actually, I think we need two pages - one listing the sponsors and one giving information about sponsorship opportunities)
* [ ] Make the sharing buttons more prominent and add (at least) Facebook (perhaps use AddThis)
* [ ] Fix the Open Graph tags on Wiki pages (the URL params break them)
* [ ] Add an h1 header to each page
* [ ] Add structured data (at least on the schedule pages)
* [ ] Do we need the workshop pages, now the schedule pages are live?
* [ ] Tidy up the front page - make it less of an info-dump
* [ ] ~~Set up Google Analytics~~ (doesn't work because the site is a subdirectory, not a subdomain)
* [ ] Set up Google Webmaster Tools
