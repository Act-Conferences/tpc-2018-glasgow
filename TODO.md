A list of things we might want to improve. Feel free to add stuff (or do stuff!)

* Add text to the pricing page about the lack of business tickets (and linking to the sponsorship page)
* Make the sharing buttons more prominent and add (at least) Facebook (perhaps use AddThis)
* Fix the Open Graph tags on Wiki pages (the URL params break them)
* Add an h1 header to each page
